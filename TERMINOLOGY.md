# Kapseli Secure Processing Environment: Terminology and Concepts for ResearchPak Documentation

Based on comprehensive research of Findata's Kapseli platform, I've extracted the key terminology and concepts that you can adapt for your ResearchPak documentation. This analysis focuses on industry-standard language for secure research environments that will help position ResearchPak professionally.

## Core Environment Terminology

Findata consistently uses **"secure processing environment"** as their primary technical descriptor, often paired with modifiers like "closed," "audited," or "remote access." They emphasize the isolation aspect with phrases like **"closed environment with no direct internet access"** and **"data secure user environment."** The conceptual framework they use is **"come to the data"** - positioning their solution as bringing researchers to the data rather than releasing data to researchers.

For ResearchPak, you might adopt similar terminology:
- "ResearchPak Secure Processing Environment" 
- "Controlled access R environment"
- "Isolated analytical workspace"

## Security and Privacy Language

Kapseli's security documentation emphasizes **"two-factor authentication,"** **"pseudonymisation,"** and **"data minimization principles"** as core security concepts. They explicitly reference compliance with **GDPR Article 32** and Finland's **Secondary Use Act**, establishing credibility through regulatory alignment.

Key security terms to consider incorporating:
- **"Strong authentication"** for access control
- **"Audited environment"** for compliance assurance  
- **"Information security assessment"** for software compatibility
- **"Log data"** that records "who processed the data, how the data was processed, and when"

## Access Control and User Management

Findata uses clear role definitions aligned with GDPR terminology:
- **"Permit holder"** - the authorized data controller
- **"Data processor"** - technical role for data handling
- **"Named users"** - specific individuals granted access rights

They describe access as **"permit-specific"** and emphasize that environments are created for specific datasets under specific authorizations. Authentication requires **"static IP addresses"** and uses **"trusted authentication sources."**

## Data Handling and Analytics

For analytical capabilities, they use terms like:
- **"Primary statistical software"** for standard tools
- **"Standard software"** for pre-approved applications
- **"Software assessment"** for custom tool evaluation
- **"CRAN mirror repository"** for R package management

The output process is described through **"result verification"** and **"anonymity requirements,"** with only **"anonymised result data"** permitted to leave the environment.

## Audit and Compliance Features

Kapseli emphasizes comprehensive logging with specific language:
- **"Processing and event history"** captured in log data
- **"Information systems record log data"** for all activities
- **"Security certification"** for the processing environment
- **"Audited and verified data security"**

## Recommended Terminology Framework for ResearchPak

Based on Kapseli's approach, here's a suggested terminology framework for your README:

**Environment Description:**
- "ResearchPak Secure R Processing Environment"
- "Controlled-access analytical workspace for sensitive research data"
- "Package-based secure computing environment"

**Security Features:**
- "Multi-factor authentication required"
- "Audit-logged data processing"
- "Pseudonymised data handling"
- "GDPR-compliant data minimization"

**Access Control:**
- "Authorization-based user access"
- "Project-specific environments"
- "Named researcher permissions"
- "Controlled data egress"

**Analytical Capabilities:**
- "Pre-approved R package ecosystem"
- "Secure package installation from controlled repositories"
- "Standard analytical toolset"
- "Output verification process"

**Compliance and Governance:**
- "Comprehensive audit trails"
- "Processing event history"
- "Result anonymization requirements"
- "Data governance framework"

## Key Concepts to Emphasize

Following Kapseli's model, your documentation should emphasize:

1. **Isolation and Control**: "No direct external access" and "closed environment" concepts
2. **Transparency**: Clear logging of "who, what, when" for all data processing
3. **Compliance**: Explicit alignment with data protection regulations
4. **User-Centric Design**: Balance security with research efficiency
5. **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data accessible, only anonymous results exportable

By adopting this professional terminology framework, ResearchPak's documentation will align with established industry standards while clearly communicating its security features and research capabilities to potential users.
