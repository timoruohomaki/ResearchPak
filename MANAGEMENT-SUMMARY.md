# ResearchPak: Enabling Secure Research with Open Technologies

## Executive Summary

ResearchPak delivers a **secure processing environment for sensitive research data** using proven open-source technologies. By leveraging R, RStudio Server, and modern containerization, we can provide enterprise-grade secure research capabilities at a fraction of the complexity and cost of traditional custom-built platforms.

## The Opportunity

Research institutions need secure environments for analyzing sensitive data while ensuring:
- **Regulatory Compliance** - GDPR and ethical requirements
- **Research Efficiency** - Familiar tools without security compromises  
- **Cost Effectiveness** - Avoiding multi-year, multi-million euro projects
- **Rapid Deployment** - Weeks not years to operational capability

## Our Solution: ResearchPak

ResearchPak implements the **"bring researchers to the data"** principle through:

### üîê **Security First Architecture**
- Isolated RStudio environments with no internet access
- Comprehensive audit logging of all data operations
- Multi-factor authentication via institutional SSO
- Encrypted data storage with controlled access

### üìä **Research-Ready Platform**
- Pre-approved R packages for statistical analysis
- Familiar RStudio interface researchers already know
- Automated pseudonymization and data minimization
- Version-controlled, reproducible research workflows

### ‚ö° **Rapid Implementation**
- **6-month deployment** vs multi-year projects
- Built on proven open-source components
- "Best effort" security model appropriate for research
- Incremental rollout with pilot projects

## Key Differentiators

| Aspect | Traditional Custom Platforms | ResearchPak Approach |
|--------|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Development Time** | 3-5 years | 6-12 months |
| **Cost** | ‚Ç¨5-10 million | ‚Ç¨200-500k |
| **Technology** | Proprietary, custom-built | Open-source stack |
| **Flexibility** | Rigid, certified | Adaptable, practical |
| **User Experience** | Steep learning curve | Familiar R/RStudio |

## Strategic Benefits

### 1. **Pragmatic Security**
While existing certified secure research environments represent a "gold standard," ResearchPak demonstrates that **80% of security requirements can be met with 20% of the complexity** using:
- Industry-standard encryption (AES-256)
- Container isolation technology
- Comprehensive audit trails
- Role-based access controls

### 2. **Open Innovation**
- No vendor lock-in
- Community-supported technologies
- Transparent, auditable codebase
- Continuous improvements from global R community

### 3. **Researcher Adoption**
- Zero training for R users
- Existing scripts work immediately
- Collaborative features built-in
- Focus on research, not technology

## Implementation Roadmap

**Phase 1 (Months 1-2): Foundation**
- Deploy RStudio Server infrastructure
- Implement authentication and audit logging
- Create first ResearchPak data package

**Phase 2 (Months 3-4): Pilot**
- Onboard 5-10 researchers
- Process first real datasets
- Gather feedback and iterate

**Phase 3 (Months 5-6): Scale**
- Expand to 50+ users
- Automate package creation
- Integrate with existing data systems

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------------|
| **Regulatory Scrutiny** | Document compliance mappings; engage DPO early |
| **Security Incidents** | "Best effort" clearly communicated; incident response plan |
| **User Resistance** | Pilot with willing teams; showcase early wins |
| **Technical Debt** | Use standard components; maintain upgrade path |

## Investment Required

- **Technical Resources**: 2 FTE developers for 6 months
- **Infrastructure**: ‚Ç¨10k for servers and security tools  
- **Training & Support**: 0.5 FTE ongoing
- **Total First Year**: ~‚Ç¨100k

## Call to Action

ResearchPak proves that **secure research environments don't require massive custom platforms**. By embracing open technologies and a "best effort" security model appropriate for research use cases, we can:

‚úì **Enable research** on sensitive data within months  
‚úì **Reduce costs** by 90% compared to custom solutions  
‚úì **Maintain security** with industry-standard controls  
‚úì **Empower researchers** with familiar, powerful tools

**Next Steps:**
1. Approve pilot project with 2-3 research teams
2. Allocate initial resources (2 developers, infrastructure budget)
3. Engage stakeholders (DPO, Research Ethics, IT Security)
4. Launch in Q2 2025
